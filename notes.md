# Regular Expressions (Regex) - A Quick Guide

### 1. **What is Regex?**
Regex is a sequence of characters that form a search pattern. It can be used to search, match, or replace strings in text. For example, finding a specific word or validating formats like emails or phone numbers.

---

### 2. **Basic Regex Syntax**

#### a. **Literal Characters**
These are the characters you want to match exactly in the text.

- `a` matches the letter `a`
- `b` matches the letter `b`

**Example**:  
Regex: `cat`  
Text: `"The cat is cute."`  
It will match the word "cat" in the text.

#### b. **Meta-characters**
Special characters that have specific meanings in regex.

- `.` (dot) matches **any single character** except newlines.
  - Example: `a.b` matches `acb`, `a1b`, `a_b`, etc.
- `^` matches the **beginning** of the string.
  - Example: `^abc` matches "abc" only at the beginning of a string.
- `$` matches the **end** of the string.
  - Example: `abc$` matches "abc" only at the end of the string.
  
---

### 3. **Character Classes**

Character classes define a set of characters to match.

- **`[ ]`**: Matches **any one** character inside the brackets.
  - Example: `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.
  - Example: `[0-9]` matches any digit.
  
- **`[^ ]`**: Matches any character **except** the ones inside the brackets.
  - Example: `[^a-z]` matches any character thatâ€™s not a lowercase letter.
  
---

### 4. **Quantifiers**

Quantifiers define **how many times** a pattern should match.

- **`*`**: Matches **0 or more** occurrences of the previous element.
  - Example: `a*` matches `""` (empty), `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, etc.
- **`+`**: Matches **1 or more** occurrences.
  - Example: `a+` matches `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, etc. (but not an empty string).
- **`?`**: Matches **0 or 1** occurrence.
  - Example: `a?` matches `""` (empty) or `a`.
- **`{n}`**: Matches **exactly n** occurrences of the preceding element.
  - Example: `a{3}` matches `aaa`.
- **`{n,}`**: Matches **n or more** occurrences.
  - Example: `a{2,}` matches `aa`, `aaa`, `aaaa`, etc.
- **`{n,m}`**: Matches between **n and m** occurrences.
  - Example: `a{2,4}` matches `aa`, `aaa`, or `aaaa`.

---

### 5. **Special Sequences**

- **`\d`**: Matches any **digit** (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
  - Example: `\d` matches `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
  
- **`\w`**: Matches any **alphanumeric character** (letters and digits) plus the underscore (`_`).
  - Example: `\w` matches `a`, `A`, `3`, `_`, etc.
  
- **`\s`**: Matches any **whitespace character** (space, tab, newline).
  - Example: `\s` matches `" "`, `"\t"`, etc.
  
- **`\b`**: Matches a **word boundary** (the position between a word and a non-word character).
  - Example: `\bcat\b` matches the word "cat" but not "scatter".

---

### 6. **Grouping and Alternation**

- **`( )`**: **Groups** parts of the regex together to apply quantifiers or operations to them.
  - Example: `(abc)+` matches `abc`, `abcabc`, etc.

- **`|`**: Represents **alternation** (OR).
  - Example: `cat|dog` matches either `cat` or `dog`.

---

### 7. **Anchors**

- **`^`**: Anchors the match to the **start** of the string.
  - Example: `^cat` matches "cat" at the beginning of the string.
  
- **`$`**: Anchors the match to the **end** of the string.
  - Example: `cat$` matches "cat" at the end of the string.

---

### 8. **Escape Sequences**

Certain characters have special meanings in regex. To use them as literal characters, you need to escape them with a backslash `\`.

- **`\.`**: Matches a literal dot (`.`).
- **`\*`**: Matches a literal asterisk (`*`).
- **`\+`**: Matches a literal plus sign (`+`).
- **`\?`**: Matches a literal question mark (`?`).

Example:  
Regex: `a\+b`  
Text: `"a+b"`  
This matches "a+b" and not "ab".

---

### 9. **Example Regex Patterns**

1. **Matching a simple email**:
   - Regex: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`
   - Explanation: Matches an email starting with one or more valid characters, followed by `@`, the domain, and then a dot and at least two letters for the TLD.

2. **Matching a phone number**:
   - Regex: `^\(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}$`
   - Explanation: Matches a phone number in the format `(123) 456-7890`.

3. **Matching a date (YYYY-MM-DD)**:
   - Regex: `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`
   - Explanation: Matches a date like "2024-12-05".

### 10. **Practical Tips**

- **Testing Regex**: Tools like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) let you test and understand your regex.
- **Greedy vs Lazy Matching**: By default, regex quantifiers are **greedy**, meaning they match as much text as possible. To make them **lazy** (match the smallest amount possible), use `?` after the quantifier. For example, `.*?` is lazy.

## Example: Matching Email Addresses with a Regular Expression
The string `r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'` is a **regular expression (regex)** pattern used to match email addresses. Let's break it down:

1. **`r''`**: 
   - This is a raw string literal in Python. The `r` before the string tells Python not to escape special characters (like backslashes). This is helpful when writing regex patterns because backslashes are used frequently and could cause errors or confusion.

2. **`[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`**:
   - `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]`: This defines a **character class**, which matches one of the characters inside the square brackets. Specifically, it matches any lowercase letter (`a-z`), uppercase letter (`A-Z`), digit (`0-9`), or any of the following special characters:
     - `.` (dot)
     - `_` (underscore)
     - `%`
     - `+`
     - `-`
   - The `+` after the character class means **one or more occurrences** of these characters. This part matches the local part of an email (the part before the `@`).

3. **`@`**:
   - This simply matches the **at symbol** (`@`) that separates the local part from the domain part of the email address.

4. **`[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`**:
   - Similar to the previous part, this matches the **domain part** of the email address. It allows lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, dots (`.`), and hyphens (`-`).
   - The `+` means **one or more occurrences**, ensuring there is at least one character for the domain name.

5. **`\.`**:
   - The backslash (`\`) escapes the dot (`.`), which normally matches any character in regex. Here, it ensures that the dot is treated literally (i.e., it matches an actual period/dot, like in `gmail.com`).

6. **`[a-zA-Z]{2,}`**:
   - `[a-zA-Z]`: Matches any letter, either lowercase or uppercase.
   - `{2,}`: This specifies that the preceding character class must appear **at least twice**. This part ensures that the email domain has a valid top-level domain (TLD) like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, etc.

### Summary:
This regex pattern matches email addresses in the following format:

- One or more alphanumeric characters or special characters (`._%+-`) before the `@`.
- The `@` symbol separates the local part and domain.
- The domain part consists of alphanumeric characters, dots, and hyphens.
- A dot (`.`) is followed by two or more alphabetic characters representing the top-level domain (like `.com`, `.org`, etc.).

### Example matches:
- `user@example.com`
- `test_user+123@subdomain.example.co.uk`
- `name.lastname@domain.io`

This pattern does not match every possible email format defined by the full email specification (RFC 5322), but it works for common email formats used in practice.

A **data sanitization strategy** refers to the processes and techniques used to cleanse and protect data, ensuring that it is free from errors, inconsistencies, or unauthorized access. The goal is to ensure that data is accurate, valid, and secure while also meeting privacy, compliance, and security standards. Data sanitization can be performed across various stages of the data lifecycle, from collection to deletion.

# Data sanitization strategy

### 1. **Data Classification**
   - **Identify sensitive data**: Categorize data into different types (e.g., sensitive, personal, public) to understand the level of protection required. For example, personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, and medical records require strict sanitization.
   - **Tagging and labeling**: Mark sensitive data for protection and ensure it is managed according to regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

### 2. **Data Collection & Validation**
   - **Input Validation**: Ensure that data entered into systems is sanitized to prevent invalid, malicious, or erroneous data from being collected.
     - Use techniques like **input validation** to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other forms of malicious data injection.
     - Enforce **data type checks**, **range checks**, and **format checks** to ensure data integrity.
   - **Data Formatting**: Enforce standard formats (e.g., dates, phone numbers, addresses) during collection to avoid inconsistencies and errors.

### 3. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Remove duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate records to avoid redundancy and potential data corruption.
   - **Standardize data**: Normalize data to ensure consistency across systems (e.g., converting all text to uppercase/lowercase, standardizing units of measure).
   - **Correct errors**: Use automated tools or manual procedures to identify and correct data inaccuracies.

### 4. **Data Masking**
   - **Data Masking**: For sensitive information, apply techniques like data masking or tokenization to replace sensitive data with obfuscated or random values.
   - This is especially important in development or testing environments where real data is not necessary.
     - For example, replace actual social security numbers or credit card details with masked values like "XXX-XX-1234."

### 5. **Data Anonymization**
   - **Anonymize or Pseudonymize Data**: Remove personally identifiable information (PII) from datasets or replace it with pseudonyms to preserve privacy. This is especially critical in analytics or data-sharing scenarios where personal identification should be avoided.
     - Example: Anonymizing names, addresses, or phone numbers while retaining general trends.

### 6. **Data Encryption**
   - **Encrypt sensitive data** both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access. Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) and key management techniques.
   - Ensure that encryption keys are stored securely and rotated periodically.

### 7. **Data Access Control**
   - **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define clear policies on who can access, modify, or delete data based on their roles within the organization.
   - Implement **least privilege** principles to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive or critical data.
   - Monitor and log all access to sensitive data for auditing and security purposes.

### 8. **Data Deletion and Destruction**
   - **Secure Deletion**: When data is no longer needed, ensure it is securely deleted to prevent unauthorized recovery.
     - Use tools that comply with data destruction standards (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M, NIST SP 800-88).
     - Overwrite data multiple times, or use physical destruction methods like shredding drives for highly sensitive data.
   - Ensure that deletion practices are documented, auditable, and compliant with regulations.

### 9. **Data Auditing and Monitoring**
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement real-time monitoring systems to detect unusual data access, modification, or anomalies.
   - **Auditing and Logging**: Maintain an audit trail of all data sanitization activities, including access, modification, and deletion actions, to comply with regulatory and internal policies.

### 10. **Compliance & Regulatory Considerations**
   - **Follow Regulations**: Adhere to relevant data protection regulations, such as the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**, or **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**.
   - Regularly review compliance standards and ensure that the sanitization methods meet or exceed legal requirements for data protection.

### 11. **Regular Data Sanitization Reviews**
   - **Ongoing Review**: Regularly review and update the data sanitization strategy to adapt to evolving security threats, new compliance requirements, and data growth.
   - Train staff and stakeholders on data privacy best practices and the importance of data sanitization.

### 12. **Automation of Data Sanitization**
   - Leverage automated tools and AI to detect and clean sensitive or incorrect data at scale, especially in large datasets.
   - Automate the regular sanitization tasks, like removing duplicates or standardizing formats, to improve efficiency and consistency.

By following a comprehensive data sanitization strategy, organizations can mitigate risks related to data breaches, maintain the integrity of their data, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

# What imputer does in data preprocessing?
An imputer is a class that is used to replace missing values in the data. It is used to handle missing data in a dataset by filling the missing values with a specific strategy. The imputer class provides different strategies to fill the missing values, such as mean, median, mode, or a constant value. It helps in preprocessing the data before building a machine learning model by handling missing values effectively.

### Example:
```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
```
This code imports the `SimpleImputer` class from the `sklearn.impute` module. The `SimpleImputer` class is used to replace missing values in the data with a specified strategy.

### Usage:
```python
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)
```
In this code snippet:
- An instance of the `SimpleImputer` class is created with the strategy set to `'mean'`.

# Outlier Removal Using Standard Deviation

### What is an "outlier"?
An **outlier** is a data point that is very different from the rest of the points. It's like a student who has a much higher or lower score than everyone else in a class. Outliers can mess up the learning process of a machine learning model, so we often try to remove them to make the model work better.

### The function `remove_outlier(data, threshold=2)`:
This function helps remove outliers from the data using a method based on **standard deviation** (how spread out the data is).

1. **Calculate the mean (average) of the data**:
   ```python
   mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
   ```
   This calculates the average value of each feature (column) in your data.

2. **Calculate the standard deviation of the data**:
   ```python
   std = np.std(data, axis=0)
   ```
   This measures how spread out each feature is. If the standard deviation is large, it means the data is spread out a lot.

3. **Check if a data point is an outlier**:
   ```python
   outliers = np.abs((data - mean) / std) > threshold
   ```
   - This line checks for outliers. It calculates how far each data point is from the mean in terms of standard deviations. 
   - If a data point is more than `threshold` standard deviations away from the mean, it's considered an outlier.
   - The `np.abs()` part ensures you check the distance regardless of whether the value is above or below the mean.

4. **Remove the outliers**:
   ```python
   return data[~outliers.any(axis=1)]
   ```
   - This line removes the outliers.
   - `~outliers.any(axis=1)` means "select the rows (data points) where there is no outlier in any column". In other words, if any column in a row has an outlier, the whole row gets removed.

### Explanation of `X_cleaned` and `y_cleaned`:

- **`X_cleaned = remove_outlier(X)`**:
  - This applies the `remove_outlier()` function to your data `X` (which represents the features) and removes the outliers from `X`. The cleaned data is stored in `X_cleaned`.

- **`y_cleaned = y[~np.any(np.abs((X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)) > 2, axis=1)]`**:
  - This is cleaning the target variable `y` (which contains the labels or outcomes).
  - It removes the corresponding labels from `y` where the **feature data** `X` has outliers.
  - This ensures that if you remove a data point from `X` because it's an outlier, you also remove the corresponding target value in `y`.

### In simpler terms:

1. **Outlier removal**: We check if a data point is "too different" from the others (using standard deviations). If it is, we remove it.
2. **Cleaning `X`**: We remove outliers from the features (the input data).
3. **Cleaning `y`**: We also remove the labels in `y` that match those outliers, so that the cleaned data stays aligned.

In short, this code helps to **remove the "weird" data points** that might mess up the analysis or model training.

## Explanation of `np.any(np.abs((X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)) > 2, axis=1)`

### Code:
```python
y_cleaned = y[~np.any(np.abs((X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)) > 2, axis=1)]
```

This line is cleaning the target variable `y` by removing the labels corresponding to data points that are outliers in the feature set `X`. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Finding outliers in `X`**:
```python
np.abs((X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)) > 2
```
This part of the code checks for outliers in the **feature matrix `X`** (the data used to predict the target `y`). 

#### Step-by-step explanation:
- **`np.mean(X, axis=0)`**: 
  - This calculates the **mean** (average) of each column (feature) in the matrix `X`. 
  - If `X` has multiple features (e.g., height, weight, age), it calculates the mean for each of these features separately.

- **`np.std(X, axis=0)`**:
  - This calculates the **standard deviation** of each column in `X`. The standard deviation tells us how spread out the values of each feature are. 
  - A high standard deviation means the data is spread out a lot, and a low standard deviation means the data is concentrated around the mean.

- **`(X - np.mean(X, axis=0)) / np.std(X, axis=0)`**:
  - This **standardizes** the data. It means subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature, so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  - This is essentially converting each feature into "how many standard deviations away" the data points are from the mean.

- **`np.abs(... > 2)`**:
  - This checks if the **absolute value** of the standardized data points is greater than 2. 
  - If a data point is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean, it is considered an **outlier** (this is a common threshold).
  - `np.abs()` ensures we're checking the distance regardless of whether the data point is above or below the mean.

- **`np.any(..., axis=1)`**:
  - This checks if any of the features for a given data point (row in `X`) are outliers (i.e., if any value in that row is greater than 2 standard deviations away from the mean).
  - `axis=1` means the check is done **across columns (features)** for each row (data point).
  - It returns `True` for any row that has at least one feature that is an outlier.

### 2. **Excluding the outliers from `y`**:
```python
y[~np.any(..., axis=1)]
```
- **`~np.any(..., axis=1)`**: 
  - The tilde `~` is a **negation** operator. So, it flips the result.
  - It converts `True` (outliers) into `False`, and `False` (non-outliers) into `True`.
  - This means **we are keeping the rows (data points) that are NOT outliers** in `X`.

- **`y[...]`**:
  - This uses the **Boolean mask** (from the previous step) to **select only the labels in `y`** that correspond to the rows (data points) in `X` that are not outliers.
  - The `y_cleaned` will now only contain the target values that correspond to **non-outliers** in the feature data `X`.

### In simpler terms:

- **Step 1**: Find out which rows in `X` have outliers (where any feature is more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean).
- **Step 2**: Remove the rows (data points) in `y` that correspond to these outliers, so that `y_cleaned` only contains the target labels for the "good" data points in `X`.

### Example:
If `X` represents features like age, height, and weight, and `y` is the target variable (like "score" or "label"), this code ensures that if a data point has any feature value that is an outlier (e.g., a very unusual age or height), the corresponding target value in `y` is also removed.

**In summary**: The line ensures that both the feature data `X` and the target data `y` are "aligned" by removing rows where any feature is an outlier, keeping only the data points with valid (non-outlier) values.
